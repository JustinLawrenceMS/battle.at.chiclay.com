This project is inspired by an episode of Nicholas Thompson's the Most Interesting Thing in Tech, and credit for the idea of pitting AI's against each other in games belongs to him.

The goal of the project is to pit AI's against eath other in games, in order to entertain and also to benchmark the AI's.  The first game I am working on is D&D (more entertainment value, benchmark games later).

Contributions are welcome.
